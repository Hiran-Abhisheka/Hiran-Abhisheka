## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Trigger the Snake Animation (First Time)

Since this is the first time setting up the workflow, you need to manually trigger it:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Hiran-Abhisheka/Hiran-Abhisheka
2. Click on the **"Actions"** tab
3. Look for **"Generate snake animation"** workflow
4. Click **"Run workflow"** button
5. Click the green **"Run workflow"** button to confirm

### 2. Enable GitHub Actions (If Not Already Enabled)

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to **Actions** → **General**
3. Make sure GitHub Actions are allowed to run

### 3. Wait for the Snake Animation

- The first run will create an `output` branch in your repository
- The snake animation SVG will be generated there
- After the first successful run, your snake animation will appear in your README
- Future updates will happen automatically every 12 hours

## 🎵 Optional: Spotify Integration

If you want to add a live Spotify "Now Playing" widget (as mentioned in the setup guide), you can:

1. Use services like **Novatorem** or **Spotify GitHub README**
2. Set up Spotify Developer App
3. Configure the necessary tokens
4. Replace the current music section with live data

But your current music section looks great as is! 🎧
